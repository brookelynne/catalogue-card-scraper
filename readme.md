# Catalogue Card Scraper
This catalogue card scraper was written for Indiana University cataloguers, to quickly generate catalogue cards to be
printed and filed as a redundancy for the electronic system. It pulls from the Indiana University
[online catalogue](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog), on any given item's
[Librarian View page](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/19858379/librarian_view), generating a card with the following fields:
- 090
- 100
- 240
- 245
- 260
- 264
- 300
- 500 if contains `5|`
- 590
- 591
- 700s (any 7XX) if contains `5|`

## Usage
